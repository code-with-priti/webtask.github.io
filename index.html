            <p class="read-more-wrap">Online vehicle parking reservation system improves the existing system since,
                 we are in computerized world.with this new system is mandatory,it enables the user of the system to reserve a parking lot online and this reduces the wasting nofb the time of the clients looking for where to park ,
                 increase the safety of the property since the parking lot is numbering.
                Online car park booking systems at the office are massively increasing in popularity.
                 It’s easy to see why. Imagine driving for an hour to get to your workplace parking lot, only to end up cruising for 30 more minutes in your attempt to look for an available parking space. You go to one car park after another and finally, you find a paid slot that is a good 15-minute walk away from your office.<br/>
                 That is already 45 minutes of wasted time and stress, you feel tired, and your working day has not even officially started yet. 
                 Unfortunately, that is the weekday story of many stressed commuters all over the world, leading to a phenomenon called car park or parking anxiety.
                 Though there is no law that requires employers to provide free parking or other commuting benefits to employees, research suggests that commuting-related company practices have a big impact on overall levels of employee satisfaction and productivity.
                <span class="read-more-target">Finding a parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours, is difficult for drivers. The difficulty arises from not knowing where the available spaces may be at that time; even if known, many vehicles may pursue very limited parking spaces to cause serious traffic congestion. In this paper, we design and implement a prototype of Reservation-based Smart Parking System (RSPS) that allows drivers to effectively find and reserve the vacant parking spaces. By periodically learning the parking status from the sensor networks deployed in parking lots, the reservation service is affected by the change of physical parking status. The drivers are allowed to access this cyber-physical system with their personal communication devices. Furthermore, we study state-of-the-art parking
                    Airlines are among the heaviest users of the online car park booking system- with 90% of UK airports using an online parking booking facility, while implementation in airports in other European countries is growing by 30% every year.
                    <br/>
                    Workplaces can greatly benefit from these time savings too. Instead of being stressed with parking, employees can have peace of mind and focus their energy into being productive at work. 

Employees who weren’t able to book a parking slot for the day will no longer line up at the parking lot too, which means less traffic and delays for permitted individuals.

It’s a system where both employees and the company win.<br/>
With an online car park booking system, employees can check real-time availability and make bookings, whether or not these are within business hours. This helps people plan their commute better, to decide which days they will be driving and which days they will be taking another form of transportation (thereby reducing carbon footprint). 

Giving employees the chance to make reservations at any time convenient for them can also help you optimize your car park, increase your revenue and maximize your real estate costs.

An online car park booking system does not require a huge financial investment and it is quite easy to set up. We strongly recommend that you make it a part of your parking management system so you and your employees can enjoy a hassle-free parking experience
